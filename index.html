Health Data Aggregation &amp; Visualization
Mobile Health Tracking
Patient Social Network

<a name="philosophy" class="anchor" href="#philosophy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Philosophy</h1>

<h2>
<a name="truly-patient-centered" class="anchor" href="#truly-patient-centered"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Truly Patient-Centered</h2>

<p>Designed as the user interface for patients to interact with your research network. Patients are the first concern, and the web &amp; mobile interface is designed for voluntary patient engagement, registration, and spreading. </p>

<h2>
<a name="open" class="anchor" href="#open"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open</h2>

<p>Open Source. Open Data. The data is owned by the patients, stewarded by the patient advocacy group. Freedom: host your network anywhere, move your network and the data at any time. Add to the network to address new needs in the future.</p>

<h2>
<a name="mobile-first" class="anchor" href="#mobile-first"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile-First</h2>

<p>The whole user experience is designed mobile-first. Patient registration, research surveys, and health tracking are designed to be done from the patient's mobile phone.</p>

<h2>
<a name="plug-ins-to-third-party-data-apis" class="anchor" href="#plug-ins-to-third-party-data-apis"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plug-ins to Third-Party Data APIs</h2>

<p>Patient health data is aggregated from hundreds of mobile health apps, so patients can use the tools they find most valuable to track their health data and see them visualized on the network. Plug-ins to patient medical record APIs enable the integration of EHR data.</p>

<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h1>

<h2>
<a name="patient-registry" class="anchor" href="#patient-registry"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Patient Registry</h2>

<p><img src="/images/demo/registry.png" alt="">
Patients register for your PPRN to learn more about their condition, learn and contribute to current research, and (optionally) learn and/or socialize with other patients. </p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="run-research-surveys" class="anchor" href="#run-research-surveys"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Run Research Surveys</h2>

<p><img src="/images/demo/survey.png" alt="">
Researchers can distribute surveys out to the patients and segment who receives them based on the patients' health record data. Return findings directly back to patients. Data collection is additive. Each survey stands on the shoulders of previous data collected.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="health-data-aggregation--visualization" class="anchor" href="#health-data-aggregation--visualization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Health Data Aggregation &amp; Visualization</h2>

<p><img src="/images/demo/dayheat.png" alt="">
In the click of a few buttons, patients can authorize incoming data streams from hundreds of mobile health apps and participating EHR systems. Patients see a visual timeline of their health record and from their mobile phone can add real-time updates as symptoms and treatments change. Researchers can crunch this data to do things like perform predictive models of disease.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="mobile-health-tracking" class="anchor" href="#mobile-health-tracking"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile Health Tracking</h2>

<p><img src="/images/demo/phones.jpg" alt="">
Patients can update their health from their mobile phone as symptoms and treatments change to grow a longitudinal perspective of their health between physicians' visits.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="patient-social-network" class="anchor" href="#patient-social-network"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Patient Social Network</h2>

<p><img src="/images/demo/map.png" alt="">
Patients can see other patients on a map, and see a listing of support groups / patient meetups near them. And ask and answer questions of one another.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="consent-once-research-forever" class="anchor" href="#consent-once-research-forever"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Consent Once. Research Forever.</h2>

<p>Up front, patients sign a Universal Portable Informed Consent, authorizing their data contribution to research projects prospectively. Patients can specify categorical control of what types of research projects for which their data can be used, and for which it cannot.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="patient-verification-workflow" class="anchor" href="#patient-verification-workflow"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Patient Verification Workflow</h2>

<p>A workflow to verify the diagnosis of patients who sign up for your registry is built-in.</p>

<hr><h1>
<a name="built-to-grow" class="anchor" href="#built-to-grow"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Built to Grow</h1>

<h2>
<a name="your-domain--website" class="anchor" href="#your-domain--website"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your Domain &amp; Website</h2>

<p>Your OpenPPRN will be hosted on your own domain (ie. mycondition.org) and your own branding, colors, and content will make your OpenPPRN yours.</p>

<h2>
<a name="grow-with-the-openpprn-network" class="anchor" href="#grow-with-the-openpprn-network"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grow with the OpenPPRN Network</h2>

<p>You'll benefit from all other participating OpenPPRNs. Patients that land on the master OpenPPRN domain  will choose their condition and get directed to your PPRN. Patients who register for other OpenPPRNs who have your condition will get registered with you.</p>

<h2>
<a name="search-engine-optimized" class="anchor" href="#search-engine-optimized"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Search-Engine Optimized</h2>

<p>Searches by patients with your condition will list your OpenPPRN in search engines.</p>

<h2>
<a name="motivating--engaging-design" class="anchor" href="#motivating--engaging-design"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivating &amp; Engaging Design</h2>

<p>Designed with reward systems from tried and true behavior research to engage patients in helping advance research for their condition.</p>
