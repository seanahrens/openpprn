Return findings directly back to patients.\r\n\r\n## Patient Social Network\r\nPatients can see other patients on a map, and see a listing of support groups / patient meetups near them. And ask and answer questions of one another.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
