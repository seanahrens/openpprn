{"name":"OpenPPRN","tagline":"The Open-Source, Patient-Centric, Mobile-First Patient-Powered Research Network","body":"## In the push of a button, deploy a PPRN (Patient-Powered Research Network) that is complete with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPatient Registry\r\nResearch Survey Platform\r\nHealth Data Aggregation & Visualization\r\nMobile Health Tracking\r\nPatient Social Network\r\n```\r\n**Customizable**: Select just the features you want. Turn on any or all of the above modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Philosophy\r\n\r\n## Open\r\nOpen Source. Open Data. No vendor lock-in. The data is owned by the patients, stewarded by the patient advocacy group. Move your network at any time. Or redeploy your network elsewhere.\r\n\r\n## Patient-Centric\r\nDesigned for patients, first. Designed with a focus on engaging user-experience to have patients voluntarily sign up on their own. Patient health data is aggregated from hundreds of apps, so patients can use the tools they find most valuable and benefit from their aggregation. \r\n\r\n## Mobile-First\r\nThe whole user experience is designed mobile-first. Patient registration, research surveys, and health tracking are designed to be done from the patient's mobile phone.\r\n\r\n## Consent Once. Research Forever. \r\nUp front, patients sign a Universal Portable Informed Consent, authorizing their data contribution to research projects prospectively.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n## Patient Registry\r\n![](/images/demo/registry.png)\r\nPatients register for your PPRN to learn more about their condition, learn and contribute to current research, and (optionally) learn and/or socialize with other patients. \r\n***\r\n\r\n## Run Research Surveys\r\n![](/images/demo/survey.png)\r\nResearchers can distribute surveys out to the patients and segment who receives them based on the patients' health record data. Return findings directly back to patients. Data collection is additive. Each survey stands on the shoulders of previous data collected.\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Health Data Aggregation & Visualization\r\n![](/images/demo/dayheat.png)\r\nIn the click of a few buttons, patients can authorize incoming data streams from hundreds of mobile health apps and participating EHR systems. Patients see a visual timeline of their health record and from their mobile phone can add real-time updates as symptoms and treatments change. Researchers can crunch this data to do things like perform predictive models of disease.\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Mobile Health Tracking\r\n![](/images/demo/phones.jpg)\r\nPatients can update their health from their mobile phone as symptoms and treatments change to grow a longitudinal perspective of their health between physicians' visits.\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Patient Social Network\r\n![](/images/demo/map.png)\r\nPatients can see other patients on a map, and see a listing of support groups / patient meetups near them. And ask and answer questions of one another.\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Patient Verification Workflow\r\nA workflow to verify the diagnosis of patients who sign up for your registry is built-in.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n# Built to Grow\r\n\r\n## Your Domain & Website\r\nYour OpenPPRN will be hosted on your own domain (ie. mycondition.org) and your own branding, colors, and content will make your OpenPPRN yours.\r\n\r\n## Benefit from the OpenPPRN Network\r\nYou'll benefit from all other participating OpenPPRNs. Patients that land on the master OpenPPRN domain  will choose their condition and get directed to your PPRN. Patients who register for other OpenPPRNs who have your condition will get registered with you.\r\n\r\n## Search-Engine Optimized\r\nSearches by patients with your condition will list your OpenPPRN in search engines.\r\n\r\n## Motivating & Engaging Design\r\nDesigned with reward systems from tried and true behavior research to engage patients in helping advance research for their condition.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
